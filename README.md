## Description
This project is a tech blog website that uses Node.js, Express,MySQL, and Handlebars. It allows the users to create an account or login if they already have one. Once they are in their account they can create a new post and it will show up on the homepage and on their profile. Once they create a post anyone can add a comment on that post or delete a comment. The original writer of a post can also delete their own posts. I'm still working on the update post feature but soon to come a user should be able to edit or update an old post.
